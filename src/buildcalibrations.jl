Build a calibration object. `tags` are references (just names) to each of the images in `imgs`. Typically, one of these will be the chosen image for the extrinsics parameters. `imgs` are the images of the checkerboard. `n_corners` is a tuple of the number of corners in each of the sides of the checkerboard. `checker_size` is the physical size of the checker (e.g. in cm). `aspect` is the aspect ratio of the images in `imgs` (most commonly 1). `with_distortion` controls if radial lens distortion is included in the model or not. Finally, `plot_folder` is the path to a directory where diagnostic images can be saved to.
